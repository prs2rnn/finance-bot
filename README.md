# Installation

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the variables

```shell
mv .env.example .env
```

Change DSN variable in `.env` file depending the way you wish to launch bot

```
# localhost
DSN="postgresql://$POSTGRES_USER:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost:5434/$DB_NAME"
# docker
DSN="postgresql://$POSTGRES_USER:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@postgres:5432/$DB_NAME"
```

The default way to use bot

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Or modify as you want. Note that docker-compose.yml file uses `init.sh` script to init database

Database volume is being created in `/var/lib/docker/volumes` local directory as *db*

# Guideline

The structure of database consists of category table and record table.

It is intended only for one user, that has access from different telegram accounts specified in `.env`.

Enter value as in template shown at */start* command and get response.

# Technical specification

Implement a simple program using telegram bot api for personal finance management and subsequent analytical research.

### Dependencies

- aiogram3.x
- postgresql as data base (asyncpg)

- Ensuring the security of interaction through the required interface. The bot responds to incoming updates exclusively for the specified id.

- Both expenses and income are accounted for.

- Ensuring the convenience and speed of making changes to the database.

- Neat and maintainable code and modular project structure.

- Secure information is stored in environments variables.

- The possibility of deducting 10-20% of income in the form of an amount going as an airbag.
